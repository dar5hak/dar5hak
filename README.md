# Hi, Iâ€™m Darshak. <a href="https://im-in.space/@dubiousdisc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dar5hak/dar5hak/master/assets/mastodon-line.svg" alt="Mastodon"></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dar5hak" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dar5hak/dar5hak/master/assets/twitter-line.svg" alt="Twitter"></a>

ðŸ˜ƒ Iâ€™m a web developer at work and a GTK developer at home. I write apps for elementary OS under [Elfenware](https://github.com/elfenware).

ðŸ’š I like reading books, playing retro games and learning languages.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently mucking around with Elixir at [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/dar5hak).
